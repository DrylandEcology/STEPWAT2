/**
 * \mainpage Welcome to STEPWAT2
 *
 * STEPWAT2 is a steppe plant community modeling tool written in c. The model
 * has existed since the 1990s, but has been overhauled throughly. 
 *
 * This documentation is meant to provide API level understanding of the program
 * for future developers. If you are not a developer you can find information on
 * running the program, figures generated from the program, and references for
 * works sited at our [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/STEPWAT2/wiki).
 *
 * \par Overview
 * There are three components to STEPWAT2.
 * \* [STEPPE](\ref STEPPE), The functions in these files deal with plant functional types, 
 * plant species, and their environment. 
 * \* [SOILWAT2](\ref sw_src), which simulates the water cycle. SOILWAT2 is developed in its
 * [own repository](https://github.com/DrylandEcology/SOILWAT2) but, since it also
 * uses doxygen, you can view its documentation at \ref sw_src.
 * \* [SXW](\ref SXW), which handles communication between SOILWAT2 and STEPPE. In general this
 * means translating soil water values from SOILWAT2 into resource values for STEPPE and passing 
 * STEPPE end-of-year biomass values into SOILWAT2 to rederive vegetation inputs for the next 
 * yearâ€™s simulation. SXW files are denoted with the "sxw" prefix.
