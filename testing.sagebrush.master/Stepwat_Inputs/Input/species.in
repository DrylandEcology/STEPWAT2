# name = 4 char genus/species name; gusa = Gutierrezia sarothrae, oppo = Opuntia polyacantha
# rg = number of resource group to which this species belongs,
#      based on the order they were entered in the rgroups input file,
#      which is read before this file.  Note that a group cannot
#      contain a mix of annuals and perennials, although there can 
#      be more than one group for annuals, for example, one for
#      invasives and one for natives.
# age = maximum age in years, 0 = no limit
#       because a group can be only annuals or only perennials,
#       a 1 here implies this species belongs to an annual group.
# irate = intrinsic growth rate (column 8, Table 2, C&L 1990)
#         for annuals, this is the proportion of maximum biomass
#         attainable with average resource availability, that is
#         reported biomass = maxbio * irate / PR
# ratep = prop of intrisic growth rate to use as maximum growth rate
# slow  = number of years of slow growth before mortality begins
#         not used for annuals.
# disturb  = disturbance class: (this is defined differently in Coffin & Lauenroth 1990
#	than it is here.
#         1 = very sensitive to fecal pats and ant mounds
#         2 = sensitive to pats, very sensitive to mounds
#         3 = insensitive to pats, sensitive to mounds
#         4 = insensitive to pats and mounds
# pestab = seedling establishment probability for a given year
#          This is the probability that propagules
#          will reach the plot in a given year.  Can be 1.0 or < 1.
# eind  = maximum number of individuals that can establish in a year
#         for annuals, max number of viable seeds that will grow to maturity
#         on the plot. ie, fecundity.
# minbio = biomass of an established seedling in grams
# maxbio = biomass of a mature individual in grams
#         for annuals, see also irate definition.
# clonal = can reproduce vegetatively (yes/no)
#         placeholder required but ignored for annuals.
# vegindv = number of seedling-sized units to add if vegprop occurs
# tclass = temperature class (1=C4, 2=C3, 0=not applicable)
# cosurv = proportion of a cohort surviving to maturity (0.0-1.0)
#         meaningless for annuals.
# onoff = turn on/off this species from the model. 1=use, 0=don't use.
#      see also the same flag in group parameters file.
# dispersal = turn on/off seed dispersal for this species. 1=use, 0=don't use.
# 	dispersal is only applicable when using gridded option.
# pseed = the average number of seeds produced by annual species per 1g of biomass, per 1m^2 and per year (internally re-calculated as seeds per 1 g biomass per plot and per year)

###PARAMETER SOURCES     
#TM - eind values are density values taken from Adler datasets from Idaho. Species vuoc (1090), bogr, spcr, brar (2080), are from Karl et al 1999
#     arfr, gusa, spp1, spp2, are TM's best guesses)
#TM - irate is from Bradford and Launeroth 2006 Table A1.4.  If a species fell in those functional groups it was
#	given the irate values. All forbs recieved the same values
#TM - maxbio for sagebrush is mean biomass from site B (calculated using Cleary et al 2008)
#TM - minbio & vegindv(used values from Bradford and Lauenroth 2006, Table A1.4)
#TM - best guesses biomass phho, brar, pssp, koma
#TM - acmi biomass Higgins and Mack 1987, spcr biomass luecro et al 2008, trdu biomass Reichman and Smith 1991 figure 2
#TM - arfr and lipu from LTER ANPP mean value for all years in 0.25m2 plot
#TM - set all vegindv to 3 (number used across the board in Bradford and Lauenroth 2006)
#TM - set cosurv to 0.01 for perennials and 0.00 for annuals (arbitrary best guesses to start with)
#TM - 4.18.15: changed grsp to lipu because of the disputed life history of grsq (annual, biennial, or short lived perennial)
#TM - lipu, gusa, spcr max life span from Lauenroth and Adler 2008 - not sure I believe GUSA though...
#TM - chvi lifespan from Peter Adler, unpublished data
#TM - koma is a short lived perennial (guess max age 5yrs); pose long-lived perennial (age similar to BOGR?)
#KP - age - acmi (10), phho (10), arfr (5), pssp (35), oppo (30) best guesses
#TM - maxage for LIPU comes from Walsh, Roberta A. (1993) Liatris punctata. In: Fire Effects Information System, [Online]. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory (Producer). Retrieved 11-26-2011
#TM - ARTR age from Ferguson 1964- Annual rings in big sagebrush book
#TM - used SGSLTER parameters for all parameters for BOGR, CHVI(chna), gusa, vuoc, chen(chal)
#TM - gusa and chvi rates from C&L 1990
#TM 10.6.2015 - testing different irate for ARTR: found 0.02 or 0.03 works best for ARTR
#		ALSO tested max biomass for ARTR - found 400 worked best but is flexible 200-500 with above irates
#		ALSO tested max age for ARTR - found that model is not very sensitive to max age but literature shows 100-150 max age
