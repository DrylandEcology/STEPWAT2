# The input line is a set of yes/no flags that define
# whether that parameter will be output, except for
# the separator character. For the flags, 'y' or 'yes'
# (upper or lower case) indicates true. Anything else
# (other than nothing) indicates false; ie, there must
# be at least a place holder.
#
# Sumry == y if biomass to be output, ==n if biomass not to be output
# Yearly == if 'n', suppress printing yearly results.
#          important if you've specified many iterations.
#          if 'y', each output file contains a full run
#          of the model with the iteration number as part
#          of the filename.
# Header == output a line of field names
# Sep == specify one of the following as a separator
#       t = tab, s = space, or any single character
#       such as , | : etc (excluding '#','t', and 's').
# YrNum == year
# Disturb == yearly: current disturbance for this year
#           summary: number of years with disturbances,
#           over all runs in this year
# PPT == yearly: precip for this year
#        summary: average ppt for this year over all runs
# PClass = yearly: precip class (wet/dry/normal) for this year
#          summary: "NA", field is output because the same
#          header line is used for yearlies and stats
# Temp == yearly: temperature for this year
#         summary: average temp over all runs for this year
# GrpBmass == biomass for each resource group number, one
#          field for each group. The resource group
#          number is defined by it's order of appearance
#          in the group parameter definition file. If
#          "head" is to be printed, the name of the
#          resource group is output as the field name.
#          For summary, this is the average value for a given
#          year over all runs.
# GrpPR == proportion of resources available to the group.
#       This is the ratio of resources required/resources available.
#       Values >1 indicate resource limitation.Each group's pr value
#       is reported immediately to the right of the group biomass.
#       summary: average for the given year. Can only be
#       output if GrpBmass is specified.
# Grpwf == number of wildfires that occured across all iterations in each year
# Grppf == number of prescribed fires that occured across all iterations in each year
# GrpSize == relative size ("equivalent mature individuals")
#         of the group. Each group's relative size is reported
#         immediately to the right of the group biomass, unless
#         pr (above) is turned on.
#         summary: average for the given year. Can only be
#         output if GrpBmass is specified.
# Grazing == if 'y' biomass removed by grazing will be outputted.
# SppBmass == net biomass for each species for the year.
#          If "head" is true, species names are output as
#          the field names.
#          summary: average value for all runs.
# Indivs == yearly: net number of individuals of this species
#        this year.
#    summary: average number of individuals for this year.
#           Can only be output if SppBmass specified.
