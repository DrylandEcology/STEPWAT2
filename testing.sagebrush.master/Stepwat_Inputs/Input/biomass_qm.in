# Quantile mapping input file STEPPEWAT

# Purpose: This file contains data to quantile map STEPWAT2 biomass
# to the scale of data from the rangeland analysis platform (RAP).
# This is to adjust biomass values prior to inputting the values
# into the fire equation from Holdrege et al. 2024, which
# was fit to RAP data. Note, this is only for adjusting
# input to the fire equation, and does not effect biomass
# elsewhere. 

# Data source (update this description if values are updated): 
# The quantiles provided below are based on the following--
# interpolated STEPWAT2 biomass values of annual forbs and grasses (afgAGB) and
# perennial forbs and grasses (pfgAGB), for simulations
# run in November 2023 (fire1_eind1_c4grass1_co20),
# all grazing levels were used (L, M, H, VH). Interpolated biomass
# data (Renne multivariate matching algorithm) were used for calculating the quantiles ('Biomass_stepwat'). 
# Interpolation was done using the same matching criteria
# used in palmquist et al 2021 and Renne et al 2024. 
# Only grid-cells that had a matching quality (euclidean distance) <0.5 and
# that were also included in Holdrege et al. 2024 (Fire Ecology) were used. 
# Quantiles of the RAP biomass data ('Biomass_rap') were calculated using running three year
# (1 km) averages of biomass. The datafile from Holdrege et al. 2024 was
# used for this, except only a subset of the grid cells were used (i.e., areas with good matching quality, see above).
# A select number of quantiles were chosen, to limit the total number of quantiles needed,
# while still representing the cumulative distribution function well.

# Anything after the first pound sign is a comment
# Blank lines, white space, and comments may be used freely,
# however, the order of input (rows) is important.

# Number of annual and perennial points that will be provided below and quantity must match
# Note: These values must be > 2
12         # Annual biomass
12         # Perennial biomass

# Quantile = Dividing points within the dataset's probability curve
# PFT = Specifies which functional group the following points represent. This can only be afgABG (annuals) or pfgAGB (perennials).
# Biomass_rap = Biomass from the rangeland analysis platform that stepwat biomass will be mapped to
# Biomass_stepwat = Biomass data that STEPWAT2 uses to map from to Biomass_rap
# Note: The data should be in increasing order for both annual and perennial biomass data
