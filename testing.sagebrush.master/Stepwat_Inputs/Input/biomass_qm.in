# Quantile mapping input file STEPPEWAT

# Anything after the first pound sign is a comment
# Blank lines, white space, and comments may be used freely,
# however, the order of input is

# Number of annual and perennial points that will be provided below and quantity must match
# Note: These values must be > 2
12         # Annual biomass
12         # Perennial biomass

# Quantile = Dividing points within the dataset's probability curve
# PFT = Specifies which type of grass the following points represent. This can only be afgABG (Annual) or pfgAGB (Perennial).
# Biomass_rap = Observed satellite biomass data which stepwat biomass will be mapped to
# Biomass_stepwat = Biomass data that STEPWAT2 uses to map from to Biomass_rap
# Note: The data should be in increasing order for both annual and perennial biomass data
