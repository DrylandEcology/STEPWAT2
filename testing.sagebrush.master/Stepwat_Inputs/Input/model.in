# niter = number of iterations to run the model.
#         I.e., the model runs niter times for
#         nyrs years; statistics are collected with
#         each year in each iteration as a sample.
# nyrs = Number of years to run each iteration of
#        the model
# seed = random number seed.  Can be set to a
#        specific number, but setting it to 0
#        causes it to be reset each iteration
#        based on the cpu clock (ie, process time).
# Note: if niter is > 1, set seed to 0.  In fact,
#       it doesn't hurt to set it to 0 always.

# niter nyrs  seed
# 200 300 7 # recommended settings for production runs
