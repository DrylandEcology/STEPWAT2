#=============================================================
#                Group definitions
# name = a name to give the group (12 chars)
# space = proportion of the resource space used by the group.
#         this must sum to 1.0
# density = number of mature individuals per square-meter, converted to `max_density` (in units of plants per plot) in the model code
# maxest = maximum species that can establish in a given year,
#          this value cannot be greater than the number of species assigned
#          to the resource group in the species.in file
# slow = slow growth rate, defines when to count stretched years
# stretch  = max yrs resources can be stretched before low-resource mortality occurs.
# xres   = 1 = use other groups' extra resources, 0 = can't use
# estann = establish annually if 1; if 0, establishment
#          for this group is random from year to year.
# on = switch to turn off this group, ie, don't produce any
#       of the plants in this group.  1=on, 0=off.
# startyr = do not attempt to grow this group until this year.
#        especially useful for invasives.
# xgrow = extra growth factor; if > 0, plants can convert "extra" ppt
#         into ephemeral (this year's) biomass by
#         grams_extra_biomass = mm_extra_ppt * xgrow_factor
# veg_prod_type = 1 for tree, 2 for shrub, 3 for grass & 4 for forb.  Refer to Soilwat2â€™s VegProd types in VegProd.h.
# killyr = kill all members of this group at end of this year.
#          0 == don't kill
# killfreq_startyr = start year for killing due to fire, which will continue at the specified kill frequency
# Prescribed_killfreq = frequency at which to implement prescribed fire.
#            if > 1 , a yearly interval at which prescribed fire will occur after killfreq_startyr. Must be set to a floating point
#			 number: xx.x, 10.0. 
#            if < 1 , then prescribed fire will occur randomly based on the fire probability specified with return interval 1/Prescribed_killfreq 
#            if = 0 no prescribed fire. 
#            Overrides killyr. These two options are obviously mutually exclusive. In addition, these options are mutually exclusive with the wildfire-cheatgrass option specified below.
# extirp = year at which all group members are extirpated
#       (without recovery) from the plot. 0==don't use, >0 == year # 
# mort =  switch to allow age-independent/slowgrowth mortality
#         functions.0 = don't use; 1 = use.
# proportion_killed = proportional killing that mimics fire at given kill year/killfreq. This is the proportion of biomass 
# 	   removed by fire.
# proportion_recovered = proportionally recovered all members of the group after kill year.
# grazing_frq = frequency of grazing.  if < 1, yearly probability,
#            if > 1 yearly interval, after grazingfreq_startyr. 
#            Overrides grazingyear.
# proportion_grazing = proportion of biomass removed due to grazing. 
# grazingfreq_startyr = start year for grazing
# biomass, along with transpiration, construct a simple linear relationship (grams biomass per centimeter of transpired water) used to calculate bvt.
# transpiration, along with biomass, construct a simple linear relationship (grams biomass per centimeter of transpired water) used to calculate bvt.

#TM - density values from Biondini et al 1998 - used density% in Table 2 for p.cool.forb (Achillea millefolium) and
#	p.warm.forb (Grindelia squarrosa)
#TM - density values for annual cool grasses from (http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/graminoid/brojap/all.html) converted 56 stems/sqft to stems/sqmeter
#TM - density for perennial warm grasses from (http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/graminoid/koemac/all.html#4) 
#  used 1052 KOMA per 2 rod squar and converted to 11 per meter square
#TM - densities from GZTX data for shrub (gusa) & a.warm.forb(chal - used same for a.cool.forb) & p.cool.grass (stco)
#TM - need density for a.warm.grass - but right now turned off so inserted arbitrary number
# space parameter for sagebrush, p.cool.grass, p.warm.grass, a.cool.grass, a.warm.grass, forbs from Bradford & Lauenroth 2006
# space parameter for shrubs was a guess (KP) 
#TM 10.6.2015 - tested various stretch values for sagebrush and found stretch of 8 to be best paired with irate 0.02
