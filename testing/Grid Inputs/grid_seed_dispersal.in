# Seed dispersal setup for STEPWAT grid version - DLM 07-29-13.  This file contains constants that are used in seed dispersal.  The rest of the seed dispersal inputs are set up on a species basis in the species input file.

#CONSTANTS from the max distance function: MAXD = (H * VW) / VT.  MAXD refers to the maximum distance that a seed can be dispersed to.  If you're MAXD ends up being really small, then you can get kinda weird results, so be careful.
#30.0		# H - the average release height of the inflorescences (30 cm in the paper)
500.0		# VW - the mean horizontal wind speed (500 cm/sec in the paper)
#100.0		# VT - the average sinking velocity of the seeds (100 cm/sec in the paper)

#SEED DISPERSAL OUTPUTS
1		# output seed dispersal (ie. the total probability that a cell received seeds for each cell for each year for each species)?  1 means yes, 0 means no
1		# output header (ie. the names of all the species)?  1 means yes, 0 means no.  Suggested: yes, as it's hard to figure out what all the numbers mean elsewise.
t		# output seperator... specify one of the following as a separator: t = tab, s = space, or any single character such as , | : etc (excluding '#','t', and 's').  Suggested: tab.

#Spinup and Seed Availability options
#NOTE: options 1a, 2a, and Xb are mutually exclusive.  Options 1b and 2b can be combined.  Cells can be empty of plants.
10		# option 1) number of years N at the beginning of the simulation during which seeds are available for germination.  Input: N years.
0		# option 1a) all cells and species.  1 means yes, 0 means no.
0		# option 1b) input for each cell: seeds of which species are available during those first N years [names & order of all species in species.in].  1 means yes, 0 means no.
# option 2) run one site without dispersal (ie, conditions of 1-site StepWat, ie, seeds available in every cell for every year) for inputted # of years x replications (eg, 500 years times 10 replications) as spinup
0		# option 2a) use this spinup as init condition in all cells.  1 means yes, 0 means no.
0		# option 2b) input for each cell whether or not to use this spinup as inits.  1 means yes, 0 means no.
