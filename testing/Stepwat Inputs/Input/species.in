# Species input definition file STEPPEWAT

# Anything after the first pound sign is a comment
# Blank lines, white space, and comments may be used freely,
# however, the order of input is important

# name = 4 char genus/species name
# rg = number of resource group to which this species belongs,
#      based on the order they were entered in the rgroups input file,
#      which is read before this file.  Note that a group cannot
#      contain a mix of annuals and perennials, although there can 
#      be more than one group for annuals, for example, one for
#      invasives and one for natives.
# age = maximum age in years, 0 = no limit
#       because a group can be only annuals or only perennials,
#       a 1 here implies this species belongs to an annual group.
# irate = intrinsic growth rate (column 8, Table 2, C&L 1990)
#         for annuals, this is the proportion of maximum biomass
#         attainable with average resource availability, that is
#         reported biomass = maxbio * irate / PR
# ratep = prop of intrisic growth rate to use as maximum growth rate
#         not used for annuals.
# slow  = number of years of slow growth before mortality begins
#         not used for annuals.
# disturb  = disturbance class:
#         1 = very sensitive to fecal pats and ant mounds
#         2 = sensitive to pats, very sensitive to mounds
#         3 = insensitive to pats, sensitive to mounds
#         4 = insensitive to pats and mounds
# pestab = seedling establishment probability for a given year
#          for annuals, this is the probability that propagules
#          will reach the plot in a given year.  Can be 1.0 for 
#          native species, or < 1 for invasives.
# eind  = maximum number of individuals that can establish in a year
#         for annuals, max number of viable seeds that will grow to maturity
#         on the plot. ie, fecundity.
# minbio = biomass of an established seedling in grams
#         meaningless for annuals.
# maxbio = biomass of a mature individual in grams
#         for annuals, see also irate definition.
# clonal = can reproduce vegetatively (yes/no)
#         placeholder required but ignored for annuals.
# vegindv = number of seedling-sized units to add if vegprop occurs
# tclass = temperature class (1=C4, 2=C3, 0=not applicable)
# cosurv = proportion of a cohort surviving to maturity (0.0-1.0)
#         meaningless for annuals.
# onoff = turn on/off this species from the model. 1=use, 0=don't use.
#      see also the same flag in group parameters file.
# dispersal = turn on/off seed dispersal for this species. 1=use, 0=don't use.
# 	dispersal is only applicable when using gridded option.
