#===================================================
# The input line is a set of yes/no flags that define
# whether that parameter will be output, except for
# the separator character.  For the flags, 'y' or 'yes'
# (upper or lower case) indicates true. Anything else
# (other than nothing) indicates false; ie, there must
# be at least a place holder.
#
# Sumry == y if biomass to be output, ==n if biomass not to be output
# Yearly == if 'n', suppress printing yearly results.
#          important if you've specified many iterations.
#          if 'y', each output file contains a full run
#          of the model with the iteration number as part
#          of the filename.
# Header == output a line of field names
# Sep == specify one of the following as a separator
#       t = tab, s = space, or any single character
#       such as , | : etc (excluding '#','t', and 's').
# YrNum == year
# Disturb == yearly: current disturbance for this year
#         summary:  number of years with disturbances,
#                 over all runs in this year
# PPT ==  yearly: precip for this year
#         summary:  average ppt for this year over all runs
# PClass = yearly: precip class (wet/dry/normal) for this year
#          summary:  "NA", field is output because the same
#                  header line is used for yearlies and stats
# Temp == yearly: temperature for this year
#        summary:  average temp over all runs for this year
# GrpBmass == biomass for each resource group number, one
#         field for each group.  The resource group
#         number is defined by it's order of appearance
#         in the group parameter definition file. If
#         "head" is to be printed, the name of the
#         resource group is output as the field name.
#         For summary, this is the average value for a given
#         year over all runs.
# GrpPR == proportion of resources available to the group.
#       Each group's pr value is reported immediately
#       to the right of the group biomass.
#       summary:  average for the given year.  Can only be
#       output if GrpBmass is specified.
# GrpSize == relative size ("equivalent mature individuals")
#       of the group.  Each group's relative size is reported
#       immediately to the right of the group biomass, unless
#       pr (above) is turned on.
#       summary:  average for the given year.  Can only be
#       output if GrpBmass is specified.
# SppBmass == net biomass for each species for the year.
#         If "head" is true, species names are output as
#         the field names.
#         summary: average value for all runs.
# Indivs == yearly: net number of individuals of this species
#                 this year.
#         summary: average number of individuals for this year.
#                Can only be output if SppBmass specified.
