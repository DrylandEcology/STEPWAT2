/**
 * \brief Performs mortality that occurs during the growing season.
 * 
 *  This function reduces "plant-space" according to
 *  resource availability, age, growth rate, and fecal pats, 
 *  ant mounds, and animal burrows. Also, succulents are 
 *  killed if it's a wet year.
 * 
 *  This function is not to be confused with mort_EndOfYear().
 *
 *  An important consideration is the fact that the age of new
 *  plants starts at 1.  Consider that for it to establish, it
 *  has already survived the massive mortality of year 0; this
 *  rate of year 0 mortality, among other factors of survival,
 *  is captured by the probability of establishment (see
 *  rgroup_Establish()).  However, for consistency with other
 *  arrays, the age-related arrays are indexed from 0.  Thus,
 *  age is base1 but the arrays are base0.
 * 
 *  The outline for this function is:\n
 *    1) Death by limited resources using eqns 7, 8, 9.\n
 *    2) Age independent mortality using eqn 14.\n
 *    3) Slow growth mortality.\n
 *    4) Succulent wet season mortality.\n
 *    5) Mortality due to fecal pats, ant mounds or animal burrows.\n
 *  With all equations from Coffin and Lauenroth 1990.
 *
 *  More specifically:
 *  - Process each group separately.
 *  - If resources required for a group are greater than available
 *    (PR > 1) for the maximum years stretching is allowed, kill
 *    plants according the rules for insufficient resources.  If
 *    PR < 1, reset number of stretched years to zero.  This means
 *    that even one year of adequate resources nulls any number of
 *    years of stretched resources.
 *  - For each species, if the user requested the mortality functions
 *    to be executed, run the age-independent and slow-growth
 *    routines.
 *  - If the current species is a succulent and this is a wet year,
 *    execute the mortality function for succulents.  That is,
 *    reduce each plant by some constant proportion, defined by
 *    eqn 16.  The parameters are defined in the group-parms and
 *    the reduction amount is computed in the Env module based
 *    on precipitation.
 *  - Execute disturbances from fecal pats, ant mounds, and animal 
 *    burrows, if any.
 * 
 *  Note that other disturbances (i.e. fire and grazing) are implemented 
 *  elsewhere.
 * 
 * \param killed Reference to a boolean. Set to TRUE if one or more
 *               individuals were killed in any species. FALSE otherwise.
 * 
 * \sideeffect Individuals are killed. Individuals are stored in a
 *             linked list in Species[sp]->IndivHead, so expect the 
 *             list to be modified for all sp.\n
