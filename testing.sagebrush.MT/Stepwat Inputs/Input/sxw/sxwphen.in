# phen definition file STEPPEWAT

# Monthly phenological activity values for each resource
# group in the STEPWAT model in percent.  Activity is defined as the 
# growth activity for that month as a proportion of the total.  
# For example, if half of a plant group's yearly growth occurs 
# in one month, that month's value for that group would be 0.50.
# Metabolic activity doesn't count
#
# First column is the group name as defined in the 
# group parameters file for STEPPE.  The name must be
# spelled exactly the same.
# Remaining columns are monthly activity values.  
# All the activity values for a group must sum to 100
# Note, need to find values here for all forbs, shrub
