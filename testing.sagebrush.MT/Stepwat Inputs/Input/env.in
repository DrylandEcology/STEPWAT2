# precipitation: truncated normal distribution.  To force ppt
# to be a single value, set avg, min and max to that value.
#
# avg = (mm)
# std = (mm) standard deviation
# min = truncate to this minimum
# max = truncate to this maximum
# dry = ppt <= this is treated as a dry year (eqn 3)
# wet = ppt >= this is treated as a wet year (eqn 4)
#       anything between "dry" and "wet" is considered average
# gsppt = proportion of ppt occuring during growing season

# Immediate reestablishment potential is denoted by min=0 years.
